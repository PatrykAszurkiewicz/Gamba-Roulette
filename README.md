<H1>ðŸŽ° Roulette Game</H1>
A simple gambling-style roulette game created in Unity (C#).

The main goal is to bet on one of three colors â€” Red, Black, or Green â€” and try to win as much as possible before you lose all your coins.
Most of the visual assets were created in Photoshop.</br>
<i>Hopefully, this can help someone cope with gambling urges in a harmless way â€” it's completely free to play.</i>

<H1>ðŸ§  How It Works</H1>
You start with a fixed number of coins and place bets on one or more colors.
If the wheel lands on your color, you win a multiplier of your bet. If not â€” you lose that amount.
