# Roulette game

Gambling game of roulette made using UNITY and C#.

Main goal is to bet on one of 3 colors (red, black, green) and win as much as you can before you lose all your money.
Most of assets were made using Photoshop.
I hope it's gonna help someone's gambling addiction since it's totally free to play.
